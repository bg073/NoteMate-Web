## Getting Started

First, install dependencies:

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Privacy Policy Setup

The website includes a privacy policy page that reads content from a text file. To set up the privacy policy:

1. Place your privacy policy text file in the root directory of the project
2. Name the file exactly: `Privacy Policy for NoteMateX 1.0.0 .txt`
3. The file should be formatted with numbered sections (e.g., "1. Introduction", "2. Data Collection")

If the file is not found, a minimal fallback privacy policy will be displayed.

```bash
npm run build
```

Then start the production server:
