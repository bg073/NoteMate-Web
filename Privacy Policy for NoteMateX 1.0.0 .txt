2. Personal Data Collected
2.1 Guiding Principle: Data Minimization
NoteMateX adheres strictly to the principle of data minimization, collecting only what is essential to provide a seamless user experience and maintain operational integrity. We categorize and detail every type of personal data processed, ensuring you understand what we collect, why, and how it is used.
User-Provided Files: When you use the AI-generated response feature, NoteMateX accesses files you select from your device, such as PDFs, text documents, or other supported formats. This data is collected solely to generate AI-driven responses (e.g., summaries, insights) and is not used for any other purpose unless specified. We only process files you explicitly choose, and no additional files are accessed without your consent.

2.2 Categories of Data Collected
Below is an exhaustive breakdown of the personal data we collect, with specific examples and clarifications:

Identifiers:
Full Name:
Purpose: Establishes your account identity and personalizes your experience.
Example: If you register as “Aisha Al-Mansoori,” this name appears in your profile and in-app greetings (e.g., “Welcome back, Aisha”).
Collection Point: Entered via the registration form.
Use Case: Ensures we can address you appropriately in communications (e.g., “Dear Aisha” in an email).
Email Address:
Purpose: Serves as your unique account identifier, login credential, and communication channel.
Example: “aisha@example.com” is used to send a verification link upon sign-up, password reset emails, or critical service updates.
Validation: Must be a valid, functioning email to complete registration (e.g., we reject “user@invalid”).
Security: Stored in hashed form to prevent unauthorized access.
Demographic Information:
Age:
Purpose: Ensures compliance with age-based legal restrictions (e.g., COPPA for users under 13).
Example: If you enter “15” during registration, we confirm you meet the minimum age without requiring parental consent.
Format: Collected as a numeric value, not a full birth date, to limit sensitivity (e.g., we don’t store “March 11, 2009”).
Retention: Kept only until account verification is complete, then used solely for compliance checks.
Behavioral Data:
Reading Patterns and Metrics:
Purpose: Enhances app functionality and user experience by analyzing how you interact with PDFs and notes.
Sub-Categories:
Time Spent: Tracks duration on documents (e.g., “You spent 22 minutes on ‘Thesis.pdf’ on March 10, 2025”).
Pages Viewed: Logs which pages you access and revisit (e.g., “You viewed pages 1-10, returned to page 3 twice”).
Annotation Activity: Records highlights, comments, or notes (e.g., “You highlighted ‘Key Findings’ on page 5”).
Navigation: Monitors scroll speed and zoom levels (e.g., “You zoomed to 150% on page 7”).
Example: If you frequently annotate legal PDFs, the app might prioritize annotation tools in future updates.
Processing: Handled locally on your device via an algorithm, with no raw data sent to our servers unless aggregated for advertising (see Section 6).
Technical Data:
Device Information:
Purpose: Ensures app compatibility, troubleshooting, and UI optimization.
Sub-Categories:
Operating System: Version details (e.g., “Android 14, Build U1B2.230922.013”).
App Version: Current NoteMateX release (e.g., “v2.3.1, Build 2311”).
Screen Resolution: Display specs (e.g., “1080x2400 pixels, 420 DPI”).
Device Type: General category (e.g., “smartphone” or “tablet”), not unique identifiers like IMEI.
Example: If you use a low-resolution tablet, we adjust PDF rendering to optimize readability.
Collection: Automatically gathered at app launch via system queries, anonymized before analysis.
Third-Party Collected Data (via Google AdMob):
Purpose: Supports in-app advertising to keep NoteMateX free.
Sub-Categories:
Device Identifiers: Android Advertising ID (AAID) or Apple’s Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA) (e.g., “38400000-8cf0-11bd-b23e-10b96e40000d”).
IP Address: Used for approximate location (e.g., “IP 192.168.1.1 indicates Dubai, UAE”), not precise GPS.
Ad Interaction Data: Metrics like impressions, clicks, and view times (e.g., “You clicked an ad for ‘Office Suite’ at 14:05 GST”).
Inferred Interests: Derived by AdMob (e.g., “User interested in productivity apps”).
Example: AdMob might show you an ad for a cloud storage service based on your PDF usage, without us directly sharing that data.
Control: Managed by Google under its policies (see Section 6).

2.3 Explicit Exclusions
To reassure users, we explicitly list data we do not collect or process:

Financial Data: No credit card numbers, bank account details, or payment information, as NoteMateX is free with no in-app purchases.
Precise Geolocation: No GPS coordinates or real-time tracking (e.g., we don’t know you’re at “123 Sheikh Zayed Road”).
Biometrics: No fingerprints, facial scans, or voiceprints.
Health Data: No medical records or fitness metrics.
Government IDs: No passports, driver’s licenses, or Social Security numbers.
Sensitive Categories: No data on race, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, or political affiliation.
Content of Documents: We do not access or analyze the text of your PDFs or notes (e.g., we don’t read “Confidential Report.docx”).

2.4 Future Collection
Should we plan to collect additional data types (e.g., voice recordings for a dictation feature), we will:

Issue a revised Privacy Policy with 60 days’ notice.
Obtain explicit, separate consent via an in-app prompt.
Detail the new data’s purpose, use, and safeguards.

2.5 Transparency Commitment
We maintain a public data inventory at notematex.com/data-inventory, updated biannually, listing all collected data categories, their sources, and purposes, ensuring you have a clear, real-time view of our practices.

3. How We Collect Data
3.1 Overview of Collection Methods
NoteMateX employs a transparent, multi-faceted approach to data collection, balancing functionality with privacy. We use direct and automated methods, each detailed below with processes, safeguards, and user controls.

3.2 Direct Collection
User Input via Registration:
Process: You manually enter your full name, email address, and age into a secure form during account setup.
Interface: A clean, guided UI with mandatory fields marked (e.g., “Email *”) and optional tooltips (e.g., “Why do we need this?”).
Encryption: Data is transmitted via HTTPS using TLS 1.3, with 2048-bit RSA keys, ensuring end-to-end security.
Example: When “Khaled Mohammed” enters “khaled@example.com,” the data is encrypted and sent to our authentication server in Dubai.
Validation: Real-time checks reject invalid entries (e.g., “@gmail” prompts “Please enter a valid email”).
Email Verification:
Process: Post-registration, we send a unique link to your email (e.g., “Click here to verify khaled@example.com”).
Security: Links expire in 24 hours and include a one-time token to prevent reuse or interception.
Purpose: Confirms ownership and prevents fraudulent account creation.
Example: If you don’t verify within 48 hours, we suspend the account and notify you to retry.
File Selection for AI Feature: When you opt to use the AI-generated response feature, you manually select files from your device via a file picker. NoteMateX accesses only these selected files and only for the duration needed to generate the AI response. You control which files are provided, and you can stop using the feature at any time to prevent further access.

3.3 Automated Collection
In-App Algorithm:
Process: A lightweight, on-device algorithm passively monitors reading patterns during app use.
Technical Details:
Runs in the background using <5% CPU to avoid performance impact.
Stores data in a local SQLite database, encrypted with AES-256.
Aggregates metrics hourly (e.g., “10 pages viewed from 13:00-14:00 GST”).
Example: If you read “Budget2025.pdf” for 30 minutes, the algorithm logs this locally without uploading unless anonymized for AdMob.
Scope Limitation: Only tracks app-specific actions, not device-wide activity (e.g., no browser history).
Google AdMob SDK:
Process: Embedded in NoteMateX, the AdMob SDK automatically collects data when ads load or you interact with them.
Technical Details:
Queries your device’s Advertising ID via Android’s AdvertisingIdClient or iOS’s ASIdentifierManager.
Captures IP via network headers, truncated to city-level precision (e.g., “Dubai” not “Downtown Dubai”).
Logs events in real-time (e.g., “Ad ID 12345 clicked at 15:32 GST”).
Example: Viewing an ad for “Notebooks” triggers AdMob to record your AAID and click time, handled solely by Google.
User Notification: A first-launch pop-up explains AdMob’s role, with a “Learn More” link to Google’s policies.
Device Information:
Process: Gathered via system APIs at app startup and periodic checks (e.g., after updates).
Technical Details:
Uses Android’s Build class (e.g., Build.VERSION.RELEASE) or iOS’s UIDevice.
Anonymizes data by excluding unique IDs (e.g., no serial numbers).
Example: If you use “Android 14 on a Samsung Galaxy S23,” we log “Android 14, 1080x2340” for compatibility adjustments.
Frequency: Collected only when necessary (e.g., app launch, crash reports).

3.4 Excluded Methods
No Invasive Techniques: We avoid hidden trackers like web beacons, pixel tags, or cross-app monitoring tools beyond AdMob.
No Background Snooping: Data collection ceases when the app is closed; no persistent background processes run.
No Third-Party Analytics: Unlike competitors, we don’t use tools like Firebase Analytics or Mixpanel—only AdMob for ads.

3.5 User Awareness and Control
Initial Disclosure: A mandatory “Welcome” screen at first launch outlines all collection methods, requiring acknowledgment before proceeding.
Settings Menu: Access “Data Preferences” to:
View real-time collection status (e.g., “Reading patterns: Active”).
Disable optional automated collection (e.g., turn off pattern tracking, though this may limit UI enhancements).
AdMob Opt-Out: Instructions provided in-app to reset your Advertising ID or disable personalization via device settings (e.g., Android: Settings > Google > Ads).

3.6 Compliance Assurance
Our methods comply with GDPR Art. 13 (transparency), UAE PDPL Art. 13 (data subject information), and CCPA §1798.100 (consumer notice), ensuring you’re fully informed at every step.

4. Purposes of Data Processing
4.1 Core Principle: Purpose Limitation
We process your data only for specific, legitimate purposes essential to NoteMateX’s operation, security, and user value. Each purpose is tied to precise data categories and explained with detailed examples.

4.2 Detailed Purposes
Account Management:
Data Used: Full name, email address.
Purpose: Facilitates account creation, authentication, and user-specific services.
Sub-Purposes:
Identity Verification: Ensures “Fatima Ahmed” is linked to “fatima@example.com” for secure logins.
Communication: Sends password reset links or account alerts (e.g., “Your login failed 3 times”).
Personalization: Displays your name in the UI (e.g., “Fatima’s Notes”).
Example: If you request a password reset, we email a secure link to “fatima@example.com” valid for 15 minutes.

Lawful Requests: Responds to court orders (e.g., user data for a fraud case).
Example: We retain your age to prove compliance during a UAE Data Office audit.
Limits: Only mandatory data is processed, with strict access controls.
AI-Generated Responses: We process the content of your selected files to provide AI-generated responses, such as summaries, key points, or insights, to enhance your productivity. Optionally, anonymized data from file analyses may be used to improve the AI model’s performance, but no identifiable file content is retained for this purpose.

4.3 Prohibited Uses
We explicitly prohibit processing your data for:

Automated Profiling: No decisions with legal effects (e.g., credit scoring).
Direct Marketing: No email campaigns or SMS blasts unless you opt in separately.
Data Selling: No monetization of your data beyond AdMob’s ad ecosystem.
Undisclosed Purposes: Any new use requires prior notice and consent.

4.4 User Scenarios
Scenario 1: You annotate a PDF daily; we use this to refine annotation tools but don’t target you with ads for pens unless AdMob infers it independently.
Scenario 2: You report a bug; we use device data to replicate and fix it, then delete the report after resolution.

4.5 Oversight
Our Data Protection Officer (DPO) conducts monthly reviews to ensure all processing aligns with these purposes, with findings reported to our board.
